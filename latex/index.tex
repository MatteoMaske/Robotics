The project consists in the development of a robotic system that is able to pick up blocks from a table and place them in a target zone. It is composed by three main nodes that communicate with each other\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Vision node\+: it is responsible for detecting the blocks in the table using a yolo model and send their position to the planner node \mbox{\hyperlink{vision_8py}{Vision node}}
\item Planner node\+: it is responsible for managing the tasks of the project, calculating the target zone for each block and sending the move order to the move node \mbox{\hyperlink{planner_8cpp}{Planner node}}
\item Move node\+: it is responsible for moving the robot to the desired position and pick up or place the block \mbox{\hyperlink{move_8cpp}{Move node}} 
\end{DoxyItemize}
